            Everyone sits for several hours a day, whether working or not. Too much sitting,
            though, can disrupt your back. Some experts even believe sitting too much is worse
            for your body than smoking.
          </p>

          <h2>How Sitting Affects Your Back?</h2>
          <p>
            Your back is supposed to move. If you sit for years, especially slouching, it puts
            stress on your lower back. That can lead to pain and other problems.
          </p>

          <h2>What Happens When You Sit Too Long</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Lower back and hip muscles stiffen</li>
            <li>Spinal discs twist and may get damaged</li>
            <li>Reduced blood flow limits oxygen supply to muscles</li>
            <li>Neck and shoulders stiffen from leaning forward</li>
            <li>Can lead to chronic pain, bad posture, or nerve issues</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Why Sitting Too Much Is Hazardous</h2>
          <p>
            Sitting all day affects not only your back but your whole health.

            <li>Higher risk of diabetes and heart disease</li>
            <li>Weak abdominal and hip muscles</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Workplace Tips to Save Your Back</h2>

            <li>Sit fully back with spine supported</li>

            <li>Use a footrest if needed</li>
            <li>Keep keyboard & mouse within reach</li>
          </ul>
