            <ul>

                What causes Kidney Stones?
            </h4>   <span className='down'>‚Æü</span><br /><br />
            <ul>
                Kidney stones happen when you have a high concentration of waste (like calcium, oxalate, or uric acid) in your urine and insufficient water to pass it. There are some of the most common reasons for this include:


                Not consuming enough water

                Consuming excessive salt, protein, or sugar

                High-fat or high-cholesterol diet

                Certain diseases, such as diabetes or gastrointestinal illness

            </ul><br />

                4 mm: Generally clear on their own


                4‚Äì6 mm: 60% risk of spontaneous passage


                6 mm: Usually requires medical care

                7% yearly risk of recurrence

                35% probability in 5 years

                50% risk in 10 years

                That is why prevention is all about hydration & nutrition
